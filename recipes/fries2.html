  <p>A very rich way to dress up your fries.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1(28 ounce) package frozen french fries (such as ore ida)</li>
  <li>3 slice beacon, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
  <li>1 table spoon butter</li>
  <li>half cap minced scallions</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon manced garlic</li>
  <li>half cup blue cheese crumble</li>
  <li>2 tablespoon half and half</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread french fries in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and crisp, 24 to 34minutes.</li>
  <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving some of the bacon grease in the skillet. Slice into 1/4-inch strips.</li>
  <li>Stir butter into the bacon grease and set skillet over medium heat; add scallions and garlic. Cook and stir until scallions are soft and browning, about 5 minutes. Add blue cheese; cook and stir with a spatula until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in half-and-half until sauce is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Arrange fries on a plate and drizzle sauce over fries. Sprinkle bacon strips on top.</li>
